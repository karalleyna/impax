    """
    Maps elements of a tensor to a higher frequency, higher dimensional space.
    As shown in NeRF (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08934.pdf), this can help
    networks learn higher frequency functions more easily since they are typically
    biased to low frequency functions. By increasing the frequency of the input
    signal, such biases are mitigated.
    Args:
      t: Tensor with any shape. Type tf.float32. The normalization of the input
        dictates how many dimensions are needed to avoid periodicity. The NeRF
        paper normalizes all ijnputs to the range [0, 1], which is safe.
      out_dim: How many (sine, cosine) pairs to generate for each element of t.
        Referred to as 'L' in NeRF. Integer.
      flatten: Whether to flatten the output tensor to have the same rank as t.
        Boolean. See returns section for details.
      interleave: Whether to interleave the sin and cos results, as described in
        the paper. If true, then the vector will contain [sin(2^0*t_i*pi),
        cos(2^0*t_i*pi), sin(2^1*t_i*pi), ...]. If false, some operations will be
        avoided, but the order will be [sin(2^0*t_i*pi), sin(2^1*t_i*pi), ...,
        cos(2^0*t_i*pi), cos(2^1*t_i*pi), ...].
    Returns:
      Tensor of type tf.float32. Has shape [..., out_dim*2] if flatten is false.
      If flatten is true, then if t has shape [..., N] then the output will have
      shape [..., N*out_dim*2].
